### … a desktop app that needs access to native APIs like the file system

**Electron** bundles Node.js and Chrome into a native cross-platform app. The user interface can be developed using web technologies like [React](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) and native APIs can be used via Node.js.
